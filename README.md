# The Lambda Python code for the infrastructure challenge

Terraform does not package/zip the lambda code, so we do it manually before hand.

You can find two files in this repository:

* lambda_function.py
  * The actual code that we want to run.
  * Feel free to have a look but we don't use this file.
* code.zip
  * The code with all dependencies bundles for use in AWS Lambda.
  * Already includes lambda_function.py.
